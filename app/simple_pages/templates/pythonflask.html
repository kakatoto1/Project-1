                    Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in
                    programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance,
                    hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the
                    functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that
                    function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1. Class
                </p>
                <p>
                    A class is a user-defined data type. It consists of data members and member functions, which can be
                    accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. It represents the set of properties or
                    methods that are common to all objects of one type. A class is like a blueprint for an object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brands but
                    all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit,
                    Mileage range, etc. So here, Car is the class, and wheels, speed limits, mileage are their
                    properties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Object
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents the real-life entities. An Object
                    is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is
                    instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated. An object has an identity, state, and
                    behavior. Each object contains data and code to manipulate the data. Objects can interact without
                    having to know details of each otherâ€™s data or code, it is sufficient to know the type of message
                    accepted and type of response returned by the objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Data Abstraction
                </p>
                <p>
                    Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming.
                    Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world,
                    hiding the background details or implementation. Consider a real-life example of a man driving a
                    car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerators will increase the speed of the car or
                    applying brakes will stop the car, but he does not know about how on pressing the accelerator the
                    speed is increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of
                    the accelerator, brakes, etc in the car. This is what abstraction is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Encapsulation
                </p>
                <p>
                    Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that
                    binds together code and the data it manipulates. In Encapsulation, the variables or data of a class
                    are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of their class
                    in which they are declared. As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes,
                    so it is also known as data-hiding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. Inheritance
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming). The capability of a class to
                    derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. When we write a
                    class, we inherit properties from other classes. So when we create a class, we do not need to write
                    all the properties and functions again and again, as these can be inherited from another class that
                    possesses it. Inheritance allows the user to reuse the code whenever possible and reduce its
                    redundancy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    6. Polymorphism
                </p>
                <p>
                    The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the
                    ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. For example, A person at the same time
                    can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee.
                    So, the same person possess different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    7. Dynamic Binding
                </p>
                <p>
                    In dynamic binding, the code to be executed in response to the function call is decided at runtime.
                    Dynamic binding means that the code associated with a given procedure call is not known until the
                    time of the call at run time. Dynamic Method Binding One of the main advantages of inheritance is
                    that some derived class D has all the members of its base class B. Once D is not hiding any of the
                    public members of B, then an object of D can represent B in any context where a B could be used.
                    This feature is known as subtype polymorphism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    8. Message Passing
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a form of communication used in object-oriented programming as well as parallel programming.
                    Objects communicate with one another by sending and receiving information to each other. A message
                    for an object is a request for execution of a procedure and therefore will invoke a function in the
                    receiving object that generates the desired results. Message passing involves specifying the name of
                    the object, the name of the function, and the information to be sent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    9. Instantiation
                </p>
                <p>
                    instantiation is the creation of a real instance or realization of an abstraction or template such
                    as a class of objects or a computer process. To instantiate is to create such an instance by, for
                    example, defining one variation of object within a class, giving it a name, and locating it in some
                    physical place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    10. Name Spaces
                </p>
                <p>
                    A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (the names of types,
                    functions, variables, etc.) inside it. Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and
                    to prevent name collisions that can occur especially when your code base includes multiple
                    libraries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    11. Constructor
                </p>
                <p>
                    In class-based object-oriented programming, a constructor (abbreviation: ctor) is a special type of
                    subroutine called to create an object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    12. Fixture
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fixtures are functions, which will run before each test function to which it is applied. Fixtures
                    are used to feed some data to the tests such as database connections, URLs to test and some sort of
                    input data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    13. Type cast
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typecast is a way of changing an object from one data type to the next. It is used in computer
                    programming to ensure a function handles the variables correctly. A typecast example is the
                    transformation of an integer into a string.
                </p>
                <p>
                    14. Unit Test
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unit testing aims to ensure that each individual part of a program works correct in isolation. Unit
                    testing should assure correct behavior of the given unit before it is integrated with other units.
                </p>
                <p>
                    15. Static
                </p>
                <p>
                    A static method is a method that belongs to a class, but it does not belong to an instance of that
                    class and this method can be called without the instance or object of that class.
                </p>
